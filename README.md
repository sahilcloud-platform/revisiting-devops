# 🧠 Revisiting DevOps

> A personal engineering initiative by **Sahil Gupta** — revisiting, refining, and documenting modern DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering practices through real-world problems and practical automation.

---

## 🚀 What Is This Project?

**Revisiting DevOps** is a hands-on exploration of how modern infrastructure and reliability systems are built, automated, and observed.

This repository isn’t just a collection of code — it’s a living record of how DevOps principles are applied in real scenarios, from the first Terraform configuration to scaling, securing, and monitoring production systems.

It’s about **understanding the “why” behind the tools**, not just the “how”.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* To **rebuild and document DevOps foundations** — infrastructure, CI/CD, observability, and reliability.
* To **solve one real problem at a time**, documenting the thought process, troubleshooting, and final solution.
* To create a **referenceable DevOps knowledge base** grounded in practical examples.
* To grow as an **SRE-minded engineer** who values resilience, automation, and maintainability.

---

## 💡 What You’ll Find Here

* **Problem Logs** — each day focuses on a real DevOps or SRE challenge, analyzed and resolved with clear documentation.
* **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)** — reproducible, version-controlled environments.
* **Automation Scripts** — helper tools to streamline setup, GitHub workflows, and local development.
* **Guides & Documentation** — concise write-ups explaining how key systems are designed and improved.

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

* Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, AWS)
* Identity and Access Management (IAM / SSO)
* Kubernetes & EKS Configuration
* CI/CD Design and Automation
* Observability with Prometheus & Grafana
* Reliability, SLOs, and Incident Management
* DevOps Tooling and Shell Automation

---

## 🧠 Why “Revisiting”?

Because this isn’t about starting from scratch —
it’s about **revisiting** what matters:

* Refining old patterns with modern tooling.
* Automating what was once manual.
* Simplifying what used to be complex.
* Measuring what was once assumed.

---

## 📚 How to Use This Repository

* Browse **problem logs** to follow real troubleshooting and architecture evolution.
* Explore **guides** to understand the design thinking behind each setup.
* Reuse **scripts** and IaC examples for your own environments.
* Learn the DevOps mindset — small, iterative improvements leading to resilient systems.

---

## 🧾 Guiding Principles

1. **Automate everything** — repeatable > manual.
2. **Document deeply** — clarity scales better than memory.
3. **Measure reliability** — if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.
4. **Fail intentionally** — failure is data; design for recovery.
5. **Stay curious** — tools change, principles don’t.

---

## 📈 Roadmap

* ✅ Establish repository and documentation structure
* 🧩 Day-wise problem solving (starting with IAM & Terraform)
* ⚙️ Implement core infrastructure automation
* 🚀 Build CI/CD pipelines and observability stack
* 📊 Add reliability tracking and SLO-based metrics
